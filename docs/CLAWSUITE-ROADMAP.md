## 💰 Cost Breakdown

### If Using Codex CLI (FREE via ChatGPT Pro) ✅ RECOMMENDED
- **Total Cost: $0.00**
- All agents use `codex exec --full-auto`
- Unlimited usage via ChatGPT Pro auth

### If Using API (NOT Recommended)
- Est. 1.2M total tokens across 8 agents
- Input: ~1.2M × $1.75/M = $2.10
- Output: ~240k × $14/M = $3.36
- **Total: ~$5.50**

**Recommendation:** Use FREE Codex CLI for all development

## 📋 What Needs Forking

### Mission Control → ClawSuite
**Source:** `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/mission-control/`

**What to Fork:**
- `data/tasks.json` structure (Kanban data)
- Task card components (visual design)
- Webhook integration (optional, for GitHub Pages sync)

**What NOT to Fork:**
- Standalone HTML file (we're building React UI)
- GitHub Pages deployment (Studio is self-hosted)

**Integration Strategy:**
- Dashboard widget pulls from same `tasks.json` file
- Keep Mission Control skill for users who want standalone view
- Add "Open in Mission Control" link from widget

---

## 🔍 ClawdHub Integration

**Available Skills:** 3,000+ (1,715+ curated)

**Top Categories:**
- AI & LLMs: 159 skills
- DevOps & Cloud: 144 skills
- Search & Research: 148 skills
- Productivity & Tasks: 93 skills
- Coding Agents & IDEs: 55 skills

**Integration Plan:**
1. **Parse GitHub repo:** https://github.com/openclaw/skills
2. **Scrape skill metadata** from SKILL.md files
3. **Cache locally** to avoid rate limits
4. **Optional:** Use official ClawdHub API (if available)

## ❓ Open Questions

### Priorities
1. **Widget selection for Phase 1?**  
   - Current plan: Tasks, Usage, Active Agents
   - Should we add Weather, Time, or others immediately?

2. **Skills browser scope?**  
   - Embedded ClawdHub search vs. just link to clawhub.com?
   - One-click install or manual CLI instructions?

3. **Terminal UI placement?**  
   - Bottom panel only (VSCode-style) ✅ Recommended
   - Dedicated route also?
   - Both?

4. **Agent view visibility?**  
   - Auto-show on wide screens (1440px+)?
   - Hidden by default, manual toggle?

5. **X Feed widget?**  
   - Worth OAuth complexity?
   - Or skip for v1?

### Launch Strategy
1. **When to deploy landing page?**  
   - After Phase 1 complete?
   - Wait for full feature set?

2. **X (Twitter) announcement timing?**  
   - Soft launch (teaser) now?
   - Full launch after Phase 3?

3. **GitHub repo?**  
   - Public or private initially?
   - Same repo or new one?

## 🎬 Next Steps (Awaiting Approval)

### Option A: Start Immediately (All 5 Core Features)
```bash
# Spawn 5 agents in parallel
codex exec --full-auto "Read SPEC-001-DASHBOARD-INFRASTRUCTURE.md and implement"
codex exec --full-auto "Read SPEC-002-SKILLS-BROWSER.md and implement"
codex exec --full-auto "Read SPEC-003-TERMINAL-INTEGRATION.md and implement"
codex exec --full-auto "Read SPEC-004-AGENT-VIEW.md and implement"
codex exec --full-auto "Read SPEC-005-SEARCH.md and implement"
```

**Estimated Completion:** 1-2 days (with parallel execution)  
**Cost:** FREE (Codex CLI)

### Option B: Staged Rollout (3 agents → test → 2 more agents)
```bash
# Phase 1: Core features
codex exec --full-auto "Read SPEC-001-DASHBOARD-INFRASTRUCTURE.md and implement"
codex exec --full-auto "Read SPEC-002-SKILLS-BROWSER.md and implement"
codex exec --full-auto "Read SPEC-003-TERMINAL-INTEGRATION.md and implement"

# Test + Review

# Phase 2: Enhancements
codex exec --full-auto "Read SPEC-004-AGENT-VIEW.md and implement"
codex exec --full-auto "Read SPEC-005-SEARCH.md and implement"
```

**Estimated Completion:** 2-3 days (with review breaks)  
**Cost:** FREE

### Option C: One-by-One (Safest, Slowest)
Build and test each feature sequentially.

**Estimated Completion:** 5-7 days  
**Cost:** FREE
