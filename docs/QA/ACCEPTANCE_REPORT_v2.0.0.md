## 5. Go/No-Go Conclusion

### ✅ GO

**Rationale:**
1. All Phase 1.2–2.0 core features functional
2. No critical bugs found
3. No secrets leaked in codebase
4. Build succeeds cleanly
5. Real Gateway data flows correctly to UI
6. Known issues are low-severity and documented

**Recommendations before public release:**
1. Investigate google-antigravity model count mismatch
2. Manual verification of undo toast functionality
3. Consider adding workspace path configuration for file explorer
