# ClawSuite — Project Overview

ClawSuite is a **desktop-first Agent Runtime Studio** for OpenClaw.
It exists to give OpenClaw builders a **single bundled application** that matches (and exceeds) the usability of the Gateway Web UI (`http://127.0.0.1:18789`) without requiring users to assemble external tools.

This project is NOT a fork, clone, or derivative of OpenAI Codex code.
Codex (the app) is referenced only as a **usability benchmark** for clarity, reliability, and user trust.

## Product Definition

If Codex is:
> "An IDE for writing code with AI"

Then ClawSuite is:
> **"A control plane for running, observing, and orchestrating autonomous AI agents."**

## Core Promise

A builder should be able to:
- Install ClawSuite
- Connect to a local Gateway
- Never need the Gateway Web UI again
