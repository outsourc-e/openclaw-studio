## Feature Descriptions

### 💬 Intelligent Chat Interface
The conversation starts here, but it goes so much further. Real-time streaming responses, multi-agent session management, and a composer that adapts to how you work. Switch models on the fly, undo changes, and keep full context—all without leaving the conversation.

### 🖥️ Integrated Terminal
A full-featured terminal that lives where you need it. xterm.js powers a real PTY experience with web links, search, and seamless integration with your agent workflows. No more alt-tabbing to your terminal app.

### 📁 File Explorer + Monaco Editor
IDE-quality editing without the IDE. Browse your workspace, edit any file with syntax highlighting and intelligent completions, all backed by the same Monaco engine that powers VS Code.

### 🛠️ Skills Marketplace
2,000+ skills at your fingertips. Browse, install, and manage capabilities from the ClawdHub registry. Give your agents new superpowers in seconds.

### ⏰ Cron Manager
Set it and forget it—but with full visibility. Schedule recurring tasks, view run history, and trigger jobs on demand. Your agents work while you sleep.

### 📊 Command Dashboard
Eight customizable widgets give you instant insight: system status, active sessions, usage metrics, cost tracking, weather, notifications, and more. Your mission control, your way.

### 🐛 Debug Console
When things go sideways, the debug console has your back. Pattern-based troubleshooting recognizes common errors and suggests fixes. Export diagnostic bundles for GitHub issues in one click.

### 🧠 Memory Viewer
Peek inside your agent's mind. Browse memory files, search across contexts, and understand exactly what your agent knows—and doesn't.

### 🌐 Browser Automation Panel
Your agents can browse the web. Now you can watch. The browser control panel shows live tabs, screenshots, and gives you manual override when needed.

### ⚙️ Provider Wizard
First-time setup shouldn't be painful. The guided provider wizard walks you through configuring OpenAI, Anthropic, and other AI providers—no docs required.

### 💰 Usage & Cost Tracking
Know exactly what you're spending. Real-time usage metrics pulled directly from your gateway, with historical tracking to catch runaway costs before they happen.

### 🔍 Global Search (⌘K)
Find anything, fast. Sessions, files, settings, commands—all one keystroke away.

### Reddit (r/LocalLLaMA, r/AIdev)

**Title:** I built an open-source "VSCode for AI Agents" — ClawSuite

```
Hey everyone,

After months of building, I'm sharing ClawSuite — a desktop app that brings together everything you need to develop with AI agents.

**The problem:** Managing AI agents means constantly switching between chat UIs, terminals, editors, and dashboards. It's death by context switching.

**The solution:** One unified interface that includes:
- Chat with streaming + session management
- Full xterm.js terminal
- Monaco editor (same as VS Code)
- Skills marketplace (2,000+ from ClawdHub)
- Cron job scheduler
- Debug console with smart error detection
- Real-time usage/cost tracking

**Tech stack:** React 19, TanStack Router, Tailwind, Tauri (for desktop)

**Not a cloud product** — it's a local tool that connects to your OpenClaw Gateway. All data stays on your machine.

Would love feedback from anyone building with AI agents. What features would make your workflow better?
